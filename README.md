## ComicBooksSwift

This is a ComicBooks app that consumes MARVEL APIs using the [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) libray, and  downloads marvel characters asynchronously using user defined code
It displays downloaded characters in TableView and Collection View.It also shows the detail view of a character with user taping.

It is working perfectly. Very soon, I will update the screenshots and help line. In this projet, I have used the [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) dependecy manger.
